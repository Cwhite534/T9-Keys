Problem to solve
  Given a keypad, where number 2 stands for letter a or b or c, and number 3 stands for d or e or f , etc, 
  as defined on keypad of a old cell phone. Find all possible words, given an input of integers.
  
   
Given a list of English words in a text file, you have to implement the dictionary in two ways, in order to fast index a word in a     
  dictionary, i.e. Hashing and Prefix Tree.
You are allowed to use the built-in HashTable class in your code. You have to test your project against both dictionary implementations. 
Pleas analyze the time complexity of your algorithm if users enter N digits. Specifically, the time cost for constructing the tree, the   time cost for dictionary searching, and the cost for solving the entire problem of N digits of input.
At least you have to implement a user interface that allows users to enter some digits on the standard input, then your program outputs   all possible English words on standard output for the input sequence. A GUI is not required.
